# YouTube Viewbot
An unfixed method for tons of youtube video views simply using embeds, python, and html

## Setting Up
Go to the youtube video, press `share`, press the button that says "embed" and copy the code. you are going to need this for the view bot to work.

### Making the website
You are going to need two different projects, to create the website. you will need to use [`Glitch`](https://glitch.com). This allows people to make websites very easily. If you dont know how to create a project, there are multiple videos on youtube.

The source code for the website is in the files of this repository.

### Registering the Views
After you have created the website, copy the link of it and import it into the variable in the python file named `youtube_link`, everything is automated after that.

## Keep The Views
You are going to need to use `http proxies` so the views will register and not be detected as a bot.
